            <h2>FSSAI Registered Business</h2>
            <p>In order to ensure the highest safety and quality standards, I registered Yumcrumbs with the <span class="highlight">Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)</span>. This certification allowed me to grow the business, ensuring that every treat I made complied with food safety regulations. This official recognition helped build trust with customers and gave me the opportunity to expand even further.</p>
