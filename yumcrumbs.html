    <div class="header">Welcome to Yumcrumbs - Baking Business Blog</div>

    <div class="blog-content">
        <h2>The Journey of Yumcrumbs</h2>
        <p>Yumcrumbs started as a humble hobby in my kitchen. I began by baking for friends and family, and before I knew it, word spread. What began as a personal passion turned into a thriving small business, thanks to the overwhelming support and love from my community. I have now completed over <span class="highlight">5000+ orders</span>, and it's been an incredible journey!</p>

        <h2>The Secret to Success</h2>
        <p>One of the things that makes Yumcrumbs special is the personal touch. My passion for baking allowed me to experiment with different recipes, and brownies quickly became one of our most ordered items. Every order was a chance to put my creativity to the test, and I enjoyed every moment.</p>
        <p>Baking was not only fun but also therapeutic. It was a way to express myself, and my customers loved the variety and care put into each creation.</p>

        <h2>Brownies: A Crowd Favorite</h2>
        <div class="creative-section">
            <p>Our brownies became a major hit among customers, with flavors ranging from classic chocolate to more creative combinations. Each brownie was baked with love, and the positive feedback from my customers fueled my passion even more.</p>
            <p>What started as a fun hobby became a full-fledged business, and my most rewarding moments are when I receive messages from customers telling me how much they enjoyed the treats.</p>

        <h2>The Therapeutic Side of Baking</h2>
        <p>Baking is not just a business for me; it's a way to unwind and relax. The process of mixing ingredients, watching something beautiful come to life in the oven, and seeing the smiles on my customers' faces is priceless. It allows me to bring out my creative side, which I enjoy most about Yumcrumbs.</p>

        <p class="highlight">Thank you for being part of my journey!</p>
